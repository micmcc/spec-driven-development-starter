## User Stories

- As a project owner, I want to invite users by email so that I can build a collaborative team
- As a project admin, I want to manage user permissions so that I can control access levels
- As an invited user, I want to see project details before accepting so that I can make an informed decision
- As a collaborator, I want to leave projects I no longer want to work on
- As a project owner, I want to remove inactive collaborators so that I can maintain project security
- As a user, I want to see all my pending invitations so that I can manage my project participation
- As a project admin, I want to see who has access to the project so that I can audit permissions

## Acceptance Criteria

- Given a user is a project admin/owner, when they invite someone by email, then an invitation is sent
- Given a user receives an invitation, when they view it, then they see project details and sender information
- Given a user accepts an invitation, when the invitation is valid, then they become a project collaborator
- Given a user declines an invitation, when they decline, then the invitation is removed
- Given a project admin changes permissions, when the change is valid, then the collaborator's role is updated
- Given a project admin removes a collaborator, when they confirm, then the user loses project access
- Given a collaborator leaves a project, when they confirm, then they are removed from the project
- Given an invitation expires, when 7 days pass, then the invitation becomes invalid

## Implementation Notes

### Database Changes Needed

```sql
-- New table for project invitations
CREATE TABLE project_invitations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  invited_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  invited_by UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role TEXT CHECK (role IN ('viewer', 'contributor', 'admin')) NOT NULL,
  message TEXT,
  token_hash TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  accepted_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
  declined_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
  accepted_by UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

-- Add indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_invitations_email ON project_invitations(invited_email);
CREATE INDEX idx_invitations_project ON project_invitations(project_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_invitations_token ON project_invitations(token_hash);

-- Update collaborations table to include join timestamp
ALTER TABLE collaborations ADD COLUMN joined_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now();
```

### Business Rules

- **Invitation Limits**: Max 10 pending invitations per project
- **Role Restrictions**:
  - Only owner can assign 'owner' role (ownership transfer)
  - Only admin/owner can assign 'admin' role
  - Contributors can only be assigned 'viewer' or 'contributor'
- **Permission Changes**: Cannot demote yourself below your current level
- **Project Limits**: Max 50 collaborators per project

### Email Templates

```javascript
// Invitation email template
{
  "subject": "Invitation to collaborate on {{projectName}}",
  "template": `
    Hi there!
    
    {{inviterName}} ({{inviterEmail}}) has invited you to collaborate on the project "{{projectName}}" as a {{role}}.
    
    {{#if message}}
    Message from {{inviterName}}:
    "{{message}}"
    {{/if}}
    
    Project Description: {{projectDescription}}
    
    Click here to accept: {{acceptUrl}}
    Click here to decline: {{declineUrl}}
    
    This invitation will expire on {{expirationDate}}.
  `
}
```

### Security Considerations

- Validate email addresses before sending invitations
- Use secure random tokens for invitation links
- Rate limiting: 5 invitations per project per hour
- Verify user permissions before allowing role changes
- Log all collaboration changes for audit trail

## Test Cases

- [ ] Test case 1: Project owner can invite users by email
- [ ] Test case 2: Invitation emails are sent with correct project details
- [ ] Test case 3: Users can accept valid invitations
- [ ] Test case 4: Users can decline invitations
- [ ] Test case 5: Expired invitations cannot be accepted
- [ ] Test case 6: Project admins can change collaborator roles
- [ ] Test case 7: Project admins can remove collaborators
- [ ] Test case 8: Collaborators can leave projects
- [ ] Test case 9: Permission changes are enforced immediately
- [ ] Test case 10: Non-admins cannot manage collaborators
- [ ] Test case 11: Rate limiting prevents invitation spam
- [ ] Test case 12: Invitation tokens are secure and unique

## Out of Scope

- Bulk user invitations
- Team/group invitations
- Project templates with default collaborators
- Integration with external user directories (LDAP, Active Directory)
- Notification preferences for collaboration events
- Project access request system

--- COLLABORATIVE_EDITING ---
# Feature: Collaborative Spec Editing

## Objective

Enable multiple users to edit the same specification in real time, with role-based permissions and version tracking.

## Background

Currently, all specs are edited individually. This feature introduces shared access, which supports concurrent workflows among team members and lays the foundation for commenting and version control.

## Requirements

- Users with `contributor`, `admin`, or `owner` permissions can edit the specification content.
- Edits are auto-saved every 10 seconds or when the user pauses for 2 seconds.
- All edits should be logged with timestamp and user ID.
- Previous versions can be viewed and restored.
- Only one user can edit a given paragraph at a time to avoid conflicts.
- Users with `viewer` permission cannot make any changes but can see real-time updates.

## Roles & Permissions

| Role        | Can View | Can Edit | Can Restore Versions |
|-------------|----------|----------|-----------------------|
| viewer      | ✅        | ❌        | ❌                    |
| contributor | ✅        | ✅        | ❌                    |
| admin       | ✅        | ✅        | ✅                    |
| owner       | ✅        | ✅        | ✅                    |

## UX Flow

1. User opens a shared spec.
2. If they have edit access, they can place the cursor and begin typing.
3. A visual indicator shows who is editing each paragraph.
4. Users can click “Version History” to view or restore past versions.

## Edge Cases

- What happens if two users attempt to edit the same paragraph at once?
  - The second user sees a lock indicator and must wait or request control.
- What if a user loses connection mid-edit?
  - Draft changes are saved locally and synced when reconnected.

## Out of Scope (for MVP)

- Inline comments and discussion threads
- Offline collaborative editing



--- LOGIN-FLOW ---
# Feature: Login Flow

## Objective

Allow users to securely log in and access their personalized workspace of projects and specifications.

## Requirements

- Users can log in with email and password.
- Credentials are checked against stored user records (`User` entity).
- On success, the user is redirected to their project dashboard.
- On failure, an appropriate error message is shown.

## Authorization

- Logged-in users can only view and edit projects they are assigned to (`Collaboration` entry exists).
- Role-based access: contributors can view and edit specs; owners can manage users and settings.

## UX Flow

- Display login form with email and password fields.
- Validate form inputs client-side.
- Show spinner during authentication request.
- On success: redirect to project dashboard (`/projects`).
- On failure: display error toast or inline message.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to view my profile information so that I can see my current account details
- As a user, I want to update my name so that it reflects my current identity
- As a user, I want to change my email so that I can use a different email address
- As a user, I want to change my password so that I can maintain account security
- As a user, I want to reset my password when I forget it so that I can regain access
- As a user, I want to see my login history so that I can monitor account access
- As a user, I want to deactivate my account so that I can stop using the platform

## Acceptance Criteria

- Given a user is logged in, when they view their profile, then they see their current information
- Given a user updates their profile, when the changes are valid, then the information is updated
- Given a user changes their password, when they provide the correct current password, then the new password is set and all sessions are invalidated
- Given a user requests a password reset, when they provide a valid email, then they receive a reset link
- Given a user clicks a valid reset link, when they set a new password, then they can log in with the new password
- Given a user changes their email, when they verify both addresses, then the email is updated
- Given a user requests account deactivation, when they confirm with their password, then the account is deactivated

## Implementation Notes

### Database Changes Needed

```sql
-- Add to sessions table for activity tracking
ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN success BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

-- New table for password reset tokens
CREATE TABLE password_reset_tokens (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  token_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  used_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);

-- New table for email change verification
CREATE TABLE email_change_requests (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  new_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  old_email_token_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  new_email_token_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  verified_old BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  verified_new BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);

-- Add soft delete to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN deletion_reason TEXT NULL;
```

### Security Considerations

- Password changes must invalidate all existing refresh tokens
- Email changes require verification from both old and new addresses
- Rate limiting: 3 password change attempts per hour
- Rate limiting: 5 password reset requests per email per hour
- Account activity logging for security monitoring
- Soft delete for account deactivation (preserve data integrity)

### Integration Points

- Authentication middleware for protected endpoints
- Email service for verification and reset emails
- Session management for token invalidation
- Error handling following established patterns

## Test Cases

- [ ] Test case 1: User can view their current profile information
- [ ] Test case 2: User can update name and changes are persisted
- [ ] Test case 3: Password change with correct current password succeeds
- [ ] Test case 4: Password change with incorrect current password fails
- [ ] Test case 5: Password change invalidates all existing sessions
- [ ] Test case 6: Email change sends verification emails to both addresses
- [ ] Test case 7: Email change requires verification from both addresses
- [ ] Test case 8: Password reset sends email with valid token
- [ ] Test case 9: Password reset with valid token updates password
- [ ] Test case 10: Password reset tokens expire after set time
- [ ] Test case 11: Account activity shows recent login history
- [ ] Test case 12: Account deactivation with correct password succeeds
- [ ] Test case 13: Rate limiting prevents abuse of sensitive operations

## Out of Scope

--- USER-REGISTRATION ---
# User Registration Feature

## Metadata

- **Type**: Feature
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Draft
- **Dependencies**: Database schema (users table), Authentication system

## Objective

Enable new users to create accounts with email verification and secure password storage.

## Context

Users need a way to register for the platform before they can create projects or collaborate on specifications. This is the entry point for all user interactions and must be secure, user-friendly, and integrated with the authentication system.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] User can register with email, name, and password
- [ ] Email validation and uniqueness checking
- [ ] Password strength validation
- [ ] Email verification process
- [ ] Automatic role assignment (default: 'contributor')
- [ ] Integration with login flow
- [ ] Account activation workflow

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Password hashing using bcrypt (minimum 12 rounds)
- [ ] Email verification within 24 hours
- [ ] Registration form validation with real-time feedback
- [ ] GDPR compliance for data collection
- [ ] Rate limiting to prevent spam registrations

## API Specification

```javascript
// Registration request
POST /api/auth/register
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com", 
  "password": "SecurePassword123!"
}

// Success response
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "Registration successful. Please check your email to verify your account.",
    "userId": "uuid-here"
  }
}

// Error response
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Email already exists"
}

// Email verification
GET /api/auth/verify-email?token=verification-token

// Verification success response
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "Email verified successfully. You can now log in.",
    "user": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "role": "contributor"
    }
  }
}
```

## User Stories

- As a new user, I want to register with my email and password so that I can access the platform
- As a new user, I want to receive email verification so that my account is secure
- As a new user, I want clear feedback if my password is too weak so that I can create a secure account
- As a new user, I want to be notified if my email is already registered so that I can try logging in instead
- As a platform owner, I want to verify email addresses so that I can ensure legitimate users

## Acceptance Criteria

- Given a new user visits the registration page, when they enter valid details, then they receive a verification email
- Given a user tries to register with an existing email, when they submit the form, then they see an error message
- Given a user enters a weak password, when they type it, then they see real-time validation feedback
- Given a user clicks the verification link, when the token is valid, then their account is activated
- Given a user tries to login before verification, when they attempt login, then they're prompted to verify their email first

## Implementation Notes

- Use bcrypt for password hashing with minimum 12 salt rounds
- Generate UUID for user ID (consistent with database schema)
- Email verification tokens should expire after 24 hours
- Default role assignment: 'contributor' (can be upgraded later)
- Integration points: Login flow, password reset, user management
- Store verification tokens in database with expiration timestamps

## Test Cases

- [ ] Test case 1: Successful registration with valid data creates user and sends verification email
- [ ] Test case 2: Registration with existing email returns appropriate error
- [ ] Test case 3: Registration with weak password shows validation errors
- [ ] Test case 4: Email verification with valid token activates account
- [ ] Test case 5: Email verification with expired token shows error
- [ ] Test case 6: Multiple registration attempts are rate-limited
- [ ] Test case 7: Unverified users cannot login

## Out of Scope

- Social media login integration (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Phone number verification
- Custom password policies per organization
- Bulk user import functionality
- Account deletion during registration process
