# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Collaborative Editing feature enables multiple users to edit the same specification in real-time with role-based permissions, conflict resolution, and version tracking. This feature transforms individual spec editing into a collaborative workflow that supports concurrent team development.

4. WHEN multiple users are viewing the spec THEN the system SHALL show a list of active users

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with appropriate permissions, I want version history and restoration capabilities so that I can track changes and recover previous versions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle connection issues gracefully so that my work is not lost

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loses connection mid-edit THEN the system SHALL save draft changes locally
