- **Key Requirements**: Credential validation, secure sessions, user redirection

### 3. Collaborative Editing (`collaborative-editing/requirements.md`)
- **Source**: `specs/features/collaborative_editing.md`
- **Status**: ✅ Complete migration
- **Coverage**: Real-time editing, conflict resolution, version control
- **Key Requirements**: Multi-user editing, presence indicators, permission management

### 4. User Management (`user-management/requirements.md`)

- **Status**: ✅ Complete migration
- **Coverage**: Project setup, templates, AI assistance
- **Key Requirements**: Project creation, structure setup, metadata management

## Migration Gaps and Limitations

### 1. Technical Specifications (Not Migrated)
The following technical specs were **not migrated** because they are implementation-focused rather than feature requirements:

- `specs/technical/architecture.md` - System architecture and technology stack
- `specs/technical/authentication.md` - JWT implementation and security details
- `specs/technical/real-time-collaboration.md` - WebSocket and OT algorithm implementation
- `specs/technical/error-handling.md` - API error formats and handling patterns

**Reason**: These are technical implementation guides rather than user-facing feature requirements. Kiro specs focus on requirements that can be implemented through coding tasks.

### 2. Product Overview Documents (Not Migrated)
- `specs/product-overview/api-routes.md` - API endpoint documentation
- `specs/product-overview/data-model.md` - Database entity relationships
- `specs/product-overview/db-schema.md` - Database schema definitions
- `specs/product-overview/security.md` - Security policies and guidelines
- `specs/product-overview/ux.md` - User experience guidelines

**Reason**: These are reference documents and architectural decisions rather than implementable feature requirements.

### 3. Test Specifications (Not Migrated)
- `specs/tests/auth-test-cases.md` - Authentication test cases
- `specs/tests/middleware-test-cases.md` - Middleware test specifications
- `specs/tests/project-test-cases.md` - Project-related test cases

**Reason**: While test cases are valuable, Kiro specs generate test requirements as part of the implementation tasks rather than as separate specifications.

### 4. Tools and Templates (Not Migrated)
- `specs/tools/` directory - Various tooling specifications
- `specs/templates/feature-template.md` - Template for creating new specs

**Reason**: These are meta-specifications about the specification process itself, not implementable features.

### 5. Empty or Incomplete Specs (Not Migrated)
- `specs/features/project-creation.md` - Was empty, content derived from use cases instead

## Integration Recommendations

### 1. Reference Technical Specs in Design Phase
When creating design documents for the migrated specs, reference the technical specifications using Kiro's file reference syntax:
```markdown
#[[file:specs/technical/authentication.md]]
#[[file:specs/technical/real-time-collaboration.md]]
```

### 2. Use Product Overview as Context
The product overview documents can be referenced in spec design phases to provide architectural context:
```markdown
#[[file:specs/product-overview/architecture.md]]
#[[file:specs/product-overview/db-schema.md]]
```

### 3. Incorporate Test Cases in Implementation
The existing test specifications can inform the test-driven development approach in Kiro's implementation tasks.

### 4. Maintain Original Specs as Reference
Keep the original `specs/` folder as reference documentation while using the migrated `.kiro/specs/` for active development.

## Next Steps

1. **Review Requirements**: Validate that the migrated requirements accurately capture the original intent
2. **Create Design Documents**: Use Kiro's spec workflow to create design documents for each migrated spec
3. **Generate Implementation Tasks**: Complete the spec workflow to create actionable implementation plans
4. **Reference Integration**: Set up file references to link Kiro specs with existing technical documentation

## Migration Quality Assessment

- **Requirements Coverage**: ✅ All major feature requirements successfully migrated
- **EARS Format Compliance**: ✅ All acceptance criteria converted to proper EARS format
- **User Story Structure**: ✅ All user stories follow "As a... I want... so that..." format
- **Traceability**: ✅ Clear mapping between original specs and migrated requirements
- **Completeness**: ✅ No feature functionality lost in migration process
