# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Project Creation feature enables users to create new projects with starter specifications and manage project structure. This feature provides the foundation for organizing collaborative specification development with proper access control and initial templates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create a new project so that I can organize my specifications and collaborate with my team

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the project creation interface THEN the system SHALL display a form for project details
2. WHEN a user submits valid project information THEN the system SHALL create a new project with the user as owner
3. WHEN a project is created THEN the system SHALL generate a unique project ID and URL
4. WHEN a project is created THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the project dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user creating a project, I want to set up initial project structure so that I can start with organized specifications

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a project THEN the system SHALL prompt them to add initial specs (feature, test, UX)
2. WHEN initial specs are selected THEN the system SHALL create default folder structure
3. WHEN template files are needed THEN the system SHALL populate them with starter content
4. WHEN project structure is created THEN the system SHALL make all files accessible to the project owner

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want to configure project settings so that I can control access and collaboration

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project is created THEN the system SHALL allow the owner to set project visibility (private/public)
2. WHEN project settings are configured THEN the system SHALL allow the owner to set default member roles
3. WHEN project access is configured THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based permissions
4. WHEN project settings are saved THEN the system SHALL apply them to all project resources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use project templates so that I can quickly set up common project types

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a project THEN the system SHALL offer predefined project templates
2. WHEN a template is selected THEN the system SHALL pre-populate project structure and initial specs
3. WHEN templates are used THEN the system SHALL customize content based on project details
4. WHEN template-based projects are created THEN the system SHALL allow further customization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI-assisted project setup so that I can get intelligent suggestions for my project structure

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user describes their project objectives THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate spec templates
2. WHEN project requirements are provided THEN the system SHALL recommend initial folder structure
3. WHEN AI suggestions are made THEN the system SHALL allow users to accept, modify, or reject them
4. WHEN AI assistance is used THEN the system SHALL pre-populate sections using LLM-generated content

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want to manage project metadata so that my project is properly documented and discoverable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project is created THEN the system SHALL require project name and description
2. WHEN project metadata is set THEN the system SHALL allow tags and categories for organization
3. WHEN projects are listed THEN the system SHALL display metadata for easy identification
4. WHEN project information changes THEN the system SHALL allow owners to update metadata
